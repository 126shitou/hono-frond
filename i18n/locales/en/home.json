            "question": "What is Text to Image in AI?",
            "answer": "Text to Image is a form of generative AI that allows you to create images simply by typing a text description. The AI system—core to the AI Image Generator—interprets the words in the input as instructions and generates an image by analyzing the connections between the words and their meanings. This feature is what makes the AI Image Generator so user-friendly, as it turns text into images without requiring any design skills."
        },
        "faq-2": {
            "question": "How Does Text to Image Work?",
            "answer": "Text to Image AI generators—like the AI Image Generator—operate similarly to other AI technologies, utilizing machine learning models and vast datasets to generate images. Essentially, the AI in the AI Image Generator \"learns\" from thousands of images and applies this knowledge to interpret the text you provide. It then creates entirely new visuals based on the language and context you input. The current model of the AI Image Generator is trained on a mix of licensed images, publicly available works, and content in the public domain where copyright has expired—ensuring AI generates legal, high-quality images."
        },
        "faq-3": {
            "question": "Are AI-Generated Images Available for Commercial Use?",
            "answer": "Yes, images created with AI features of the AI Image Generator that are out of beta can be used commercially. For features still in beta, you can generally use the generated images for commercial purposes, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the product terms or a specific agreement. The AI Image Generator is designed to support both personal and commercial projects, so you can use its AI-generated images with confidence for client work, marketing, or any other commercial endeavor."

        "faq-4": {
            "question": "What if I’m not satisfied with the transformation results?",
            "answer": "We suggest refining your prompt for more clarity, experimenting with different transformation strength levels, or generating multiple variations. If needed, our support team is here to assist in optimizing your results."
        },
        "faq-5": {
            "question": "How long does the transformation take?",
            "answer": "Typically, transformations finish within seconds, though more intricate changes may take up to a minute. You can also generate multiple outputs at once to quickly explore various options."
        },
        "faq-6": {
            "question": "What types of prompts work best?",
            "answer": "Detailed, specific prompts that describe style, composition, lighting, and subject matter yield the best results. The more information you provide about your desired image, the more accurately the AI can interpret your vision."
        },
        "faq-7": {
            "question": "Are there any limitations to using AI  Image Generator?",
            "answer": "While our platform excels at a wide range of image styles and concepts, extremely abstract or ambiguous prompts may produce varied results. Additionally, all users must adhere to our content policies prohibiting inappropriate or harmful content generation."

        "faq-8": {
            "question": "How does Image to Image differ from Text to Image generation?",
            "answer": "Image to Image uses your existing image as a starting point, maintaining its core structure while applying transformations. Text to Image creates completely new images from text descriptions with no visual reference point."
